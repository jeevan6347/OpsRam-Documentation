## What is Patch Management?
Patch management works to secure your endpoints from vulnerabilities and ensure your systems are running perfectly. Patch Management does this by applying updates to software, drivers, and firmware throughout your network.

Patching is also a process to repair a vulnerability or a flaw that is identified after the release of an application or software. Newly released patches by the respective vendors can fix a bug or a security flaw and can help to enhance applications with new features, and fix security vulnerabilities.

Without a proper patch management process, you are exposed to vulnerabilities, including loss of valuable data, productivity, and industry reputation. Effective patch management is key to ensuring your team stays productive, and systems continue to work year-round.
